Analysis

Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) (when the target is the first element).
Average Case: O(n) (when the target is somewhere in the middle).
Worst Case: O(n) (when the target is the last element or not present)

Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) (when the target is the middle element).
Average Case: O(log n) (due to the halving of the search space).
Worst Case: O(log n) (when the target is at the end of the search).

Suitable Algorithm for the Platform:
Binary Search: More suitable for the platform if the product list is sorted. It provides faster search times (O(log n)) compared to linear search (O(n)), making it ideal for large datasets.
Linear Search: Can be used if the dataset is small or if the list is unsorted, as it does not require preprocessing (sorting).
