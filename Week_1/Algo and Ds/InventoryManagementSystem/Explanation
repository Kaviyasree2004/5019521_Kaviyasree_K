Why Data Structures and Algorithms Are Essential in Handling Large Inventories:

1)Fast Retrieval
2)Efficient Updates
3)Scalability
4)Memory Management

Types of Data Structures Suitable for This Problem:
ArrayList
HashMap
TreeMap
LinkedList

Analysis:

Time Complexity Analysis:

-->Add Product: The time complexity for adding a product using HashMap is O(1) on average because it uses a hash function to determine the index.
-->Update Product: The time complexity for updating a product is O(1) on average since it involves accessing the HashMap and updating the value.
-->Delete Product: The time complexity for deleting a product is O(1) on average as it involves removing the entry from the HashMap.

Optimization Discussion
Optimize Hash Function: Ensure the hash function used by the HashMap distributes keys uniformly to avoid collisions.
